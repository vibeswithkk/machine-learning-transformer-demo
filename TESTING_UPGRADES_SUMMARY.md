# Testing Framework Upgrades Summary

This document summarizes all the upgrades made to the testing framework as requested.

## Requirements Fulfilled

### 1. Coverage Report
- Added `pytest-cov` support for detailed coverage reporting
- Configured coverage thresholds in `pyproject.toml`
- Added coverage reporting to README.md documentation
- Created HTML and XML coverage report generation

### 2. Parametrized Tests (pytest style)
- Migrated all tests from unittest to pytest
- Removed all `self.assertEqual` patterns
- Implemented `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for testing multiple configurations
- Used pytest fixtures for test data setup

### 3. GPU Sanity Check
- Added GPU tests with `@pytest.mark.skipif(not torch.cuda.is_available(), reason="CUDA not available")`
- Created separate GPU test functions for forward pass and batch processing
- Implemented proper device handling in GPU tests

### 4. Serialization Stress Test
- Added comprehensive serialization stress test
- Test saves and loads model, tokenizer, and optimizer state
- Verifies prediction consistency after loading
- Tests cross-environment compatibility

### 5. Benchmark Extension
- Added CPU benchmark tests with performance measurements
- Added GPU benchmark tests with throughput calculations
- Implemented warm-up periods for accurate benchmarking
- Added performance logging to benchmark tests

### 6. Smaller Improvements

#### Coverage Report Integration
- Added `pytest-cov` or `coverage.py` integration
- Configured `pytest --cov=src tests/` command
- Set up coverage failure thresholds

#### GPU Test Guards
- Implemented `@pytest.mark.skipif` decorators for CUDA availability
- Added proper error handling for GPU tests

#### Property-based Testing with Hypothesis
- Integrated Hypothesis library for property-based testing
- Added tests for variable batch sizes
- Added tests for variable sequence lengths
- Added tests for dropout variations

#### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Created `.github/workflows/test.yml` for automated testing
- Configured matrix testing for multiple Python versions
- Added coverage upload to Codecov
- Set up automatic test execution on push/pull request

## Files Modified/Added

### Core Test File
- `tests/test_model.py` - Completely rewritten with pytest patterns

### Configuration Files
- `pyproject.toml` - Added pytest and coverage configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Added testing dependencies
- `setup.py` - Added test extras_require

### CI/CD Pipeline
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Updated with testing information
- `TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing documentation
- `TESTING_UPGRADES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Utility Scripts
- `verify_installation.py` - Dependency verification script
- `run_sample_test.py` - Simple test runner
- `run_tests_with_coverage.py` - Coverage reporting script
- `demo_run.py` - Updated with testing information

## Key Test Improvements

### Before (unittest style)
```python
class TestModelConfig(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_default_initialization(self):
        config = ModelConfig()
        self.assertEqual(config.vocab_size, 30522)
        # ... more self.assertEqual calls
```

### After (pytest style)
```python
def test_model_config_default_values():
    config = ModelConfig()
    assert config.vocab_size == 30522
    # ... more assert statements

@pytest.mark.parametrize("vocab_size,d_model,nhead", [
    (30522, 512, 8),
    (1000, 128, 4),
])
def test_model_config_initialization(vocab_size, d_model, nhead):
    config = ModelConfig(vocab_size=vocab_size, d_model=d_model, nhead=nhead)
    assert config.vocab_size == vocab_size
    assert config.d_model == d_model
    assert config.nhead == nhead
```

## Usage Examples

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/

# Run with HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html tests/

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_model.py::test_model_config_default_values
```

### GPU Testing
```bash
# Run only GPU tests (if CUDA available)
pytest -k "gpu"

# Run tests excluding GPU tests
pytest -k "not gpu"
```

### Property-based Testing
```bash
# Run property-based tests
pytest -k "hypothesis"
```
